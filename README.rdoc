Small and dumb library application. Using as a data source the Calibre sqlite3 metadata.db

* This is experimental, lot of features are missing, possibly broken, and wrongly implemented. You have been warned.
* Use calibre as a basis, so it implies that you are currently using Calibre to index and archive your ebook library.
* To test it, just copy your Calibre metadata.db (you should find it inside you calibre library directory), and set it as the development database.
* bundle install and then bundle exec rails s
